# AnimationPlayer frames times in Milliseconds
Godot Plugin for get Frames times of an AnimationPlayer in milliseconds. This can be useful if you want to synchronize the timing of animations made with `AnimationPlayer` with your Aseprite project. Because Asesprite handles frame times in a different way than Godot.

# How to use
Just copy the `addons/get_animplayer_frame_millis` folder to your addons. And enable the plugin from Project Settings.
Now you have a new dock, select any `AnimationPlayer` and in the dock you can get all frame data. When you click any frame button, the frame duration in milliseconds will be copied to clipboard.

### Note:
In the project there are several example animations with different situations in which the plugin does its job correctly. Although I can not guarantee that it will always work well beyond the examples provided.
